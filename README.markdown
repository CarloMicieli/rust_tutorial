Rust Tutorial
=============

Sample code I wrote while playing around with the **Rust programming language**.

### How to build and run tests

This project requires a working installation of the rust toolchain (`rustup`):

```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

To run the tests:

```
$ cargo test
```
